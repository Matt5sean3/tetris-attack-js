# Tetris Attack JS

An open-source implementation of the old SNES game Tetris Attack (also known as
Panel de Pon).
This aims to be an exact replica in terms of gameplay but with future
improvements to things like online multiplayer (which in the original there is
of course none).

This is based upon an earlier code draft in go-lang in collaboration with
@jessethegame, called [go-attack](https://github.com/jessethegame/go-attack)

Tetris Attack JS is currently in development.

A mostly up-to-date version can be played here:
